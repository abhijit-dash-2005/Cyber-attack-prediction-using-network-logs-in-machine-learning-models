# Cyber-attack-prediction-using-network-logs-in-machine-learning-models
I have designed an appropriate model for Cyber attack prediction 
i have downloaded the dataset from  https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html 
just download it and at first 
1. preprocess the data
2. feature selection of data
3. train the data by using ML models like ( Random Forest , SVM , ANN )
4. make sure you have saved your .pkl file and .h5 file for API creation purpose for checking real time Usage
5. then make a API and test it
6. Deployment ( As per your Choice )

Note :- I have shared the literature Review For betterment of the project ans see who have done what type of researches
